Resync-Edit is a program which helps you trim your videos. It's primarily meant for use by people who use programs like Nvidia Instant Replay, and AMD ReLive.

Resync-Edit is meant as a FOSS alternative to the Windows Movie Editor, allowing people to instantly trim videos, while NOT Re-Encoding them.

## Features
- Library with all of your clips which are instantly searchable
- Ability to trim videos in under a second
- Right click "Edit with Resync" menu, allowing you to quickly edit any video from the file explorer.
